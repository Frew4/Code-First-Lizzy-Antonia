	<h1>Jackson Pollock</h1>
	<p>In 1929, Jackson Pollock studied in New York under regionalist painter, Thomas Hart Benton. During the early 1930s he worked in the Regionalist style, as well as being influenced by Mexican muralist painter such as Digo Rivera, and certain aspects of Surrealism.</p>
	<p>In November 1939, The Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted an exhibition entitled: Picasso: 40 Years of His Art â€“ the exhibit made Pollock realise the expressive power of European modernism. He began to forge a new style of semi-abstract art.</p>
