				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>Paul Jackson Pollock, known professionally as Jackson Pollock, was an American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement. He was well known for his unique style of drip painting.</p>
				<p>Pollock was born 28 January 1912. During his lifetime, Pollock enjoyed considerable fame and notoriety; he was a major artist of his generation. Regarded as reclusive, he had a volatile personality, and struggled with alcoholism for most of his life. In 1945, he married the artist Lee Krasner, who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy.</p>
				<p>Pollock died 11 August 1956 at the age of 44 in an alcohol-related single-car accident when he was driving. In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967. In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.</p>

					<h2>Early Work</h2>
					<p>In 1929, Jackson Pollock studied in New York under regionalist painter, Thomas Hart Benton. During the early 1930s he worked in the Regionalist style, as well as being influenced by Mexican muralist painter such as Digo Rivera, and certain aspects of Surrealism.</p>
					<p>In November 1939, The Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted an exhibition entitled: Picasso: 40 Years of His Art â€“ the exhibit made Pollock realise the expressive power of European modernism. He began to forge a new style of semi-abstract art.</p>
